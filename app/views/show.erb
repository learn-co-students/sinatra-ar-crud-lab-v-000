<!-- MAKING OUR DELETE "BUTTON"
In order to make a form that looks like a button, all we need to 
do is make a form that has no input fields, only a "submit" button 
with a value of "delete". So, give your form tag a method of "post" 
and an action of "/posts/:id/delete'. Make sure to dynamically set 
the :id of the form action! You'll also need to make sure the form 
includes the hidden input tag to change the request from post to delete. -->

<!-- <form method="POST" action='/posts/<%=params[:id]%>/delete'>
  <% #binding.pry %>
  <input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete">
  <p>This button deletes this blog post <button type="reset" id="delete"></button></p>
</form> -->

<form method="POST" action="/posts/<%=params[:id]%>/delete">
  <input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete">
  <input type="submit" value="delete">
</form>
